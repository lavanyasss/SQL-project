SQL-project

Codecademy Learners Mockup Data

Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Use your knowledge of SQL and analyze some mockup Codecademy learners data. There are two tables:

users table:

user_id
email_domain
country
postal
mobile_app
sign_up_at
progress table:

user_id
learn_cpp
learn_sql
learn_html
learn_javascript
learn_java

Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. If you need help setting up your computer, be sure to check out our SQLite setup guide. You can then run SQL commands from your terminal, or install DB Browser to run SQL commands from a desktop application. Our article on running SQL commands in DB Browser will walk you through opening a database file and running queries.
