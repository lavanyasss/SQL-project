/*The data type of the sign_up_at column is DATETIME. It is for storing a date/time value in the database.

Notice that the values are formatted like:

2015-01-01 18:33:52

So the format is:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.

It takes two arguments:

strftime(format, column)*/

What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
What courses are the Chicago students taking?*/
